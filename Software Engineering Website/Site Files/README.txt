Computer Science Central Webapp


DESCRIPTION


Computer Science Central is a website that acts as a resource for people looking for help with computer science related issues. There are two major features to the site. The first major feature is a video section where people can upload videos to the website that explain computer science concepts. The second feature allows users to post computer science related problems, and then other users can post solutions to those problems as well as discuss the posted solutions.


NAVIGATION


On the main page of the website there is a header that acts as the main navigation for the site. This site header is how you navigate from one feature to the next. From here you can access links to the video section, the algorithm problems sections, as well as the register and login features of the website. 


The registration pages are pretty straight forward in terms of navigation since there's only one page for each function. 


For the algorithm section, there’s navigation buttons on the bottom of the first page that cause the page to display different sets of topics. These same navigation buttons are displayed when you select a topic (for navigating between sets of solutions) and when you select a solution (for navigating between sets of comments). There is a button for adding topics on the main algorithms page, there are buttons for deleting a topic as well as posting solutions on each topic page, and then theres a button for posting comments on each solution page. 


For the video library feature, there's a search box that will match the entered video title with the available video titles. Another button on this page is the upload videos button (higlighted in white). This button is only useable by administrators and will display and error when it is not used by an administrator. When the upload button is clicked a page with a form of four text boxes will appear. The administrator will be asked to fill out the text boxes and then click upload. After this the video will successfully appear under the available videos and through the search function. Under that is a list of videos avaialable in the web application's video library. Clicking on the title of a video in the available videos section or in the search results will take the user to the video's page. The video page contains a way to rate the video and the way to comment on the video. The video rating is an average of all the ratings given by the users. And the under video comments there be comments of the video posted by the users of the website.

SECTIONS COMPLETED AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION


The base functionality for the algorithm section of the website is complete. Users can post new topics, add solutions to those topics, and comment on solutions. This was the base functionality that needed to be in for the section to be complete. If this section was to be expanded in the future, there could be something where more things were marked to show what users had posted them. Right now only the comment section has this functionality but it could be extended to include the topics and the solutions. Future iterations of the feature could also include the option to search for content which could help cut down on the same kinds of topics being repeatedly uploaded.


For the video library feature, the functionality is also complete. Users can view, search, comment, and rate videos. Additionaly admins can upload new videos. These were the base functionalities that were needed to be done for this feature to be compelte. This feature of the web application cab definitly be expanded through interface and style improvements. Also with a better server, the videos can be uploaded and streamed directly isntead of relying on third-party websites.


OTHER INFORMATION


For the algorithms section of the site, most functionality that involves viewing content can be done by anyone, even if they’re not logged into the website. Any functionality that involves adding new content to the site can only be done by users that are logged into an account. Only one function, the delete topic option, is restricted to administrator accounts only.


For the video library feature of the web application, everything can be done by the user except the video uploading function. The users can comment, rate, view comments, view ratings, and search for videos. The administrators can do all of the aforementioned in addition to uploading videos.
